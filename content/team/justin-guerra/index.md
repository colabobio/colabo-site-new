Justin graduated from The University of Texas at San Antonio with a B.S in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics. My current research interests are using ML and statistical methods to analyze public health data to provide insights on disease from different populations. I am currently working on analyzing data for the PERM project to predict the chance of malnutrition within Indian children from public data. Outside of work, I love playing and teaching chess around the East Coast!
