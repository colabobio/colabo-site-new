A Texas native, Rachel graduated with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Trinity University. During her rotation, Rachel learned about the applications of epidemiological models to current outbreaks and diseases. When she gets screen fatigue and canâ€™t binge TV shows, she likes to explore New England's hiking trails.
