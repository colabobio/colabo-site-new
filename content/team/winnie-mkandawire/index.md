Meet Winnie, a PhD candidate with an interdisciplinary flair! She has postgraduate academic background in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, Epidemiology/Biostatistics, and Data Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, University of Malawi – College of Medicine, and Imperial College London and an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science from Mzuzu University. Her research, in collaboration with the Pardis Sabeti Lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, blends AI, Data Science, Computational/Digital Epidemiology, and Bioinformatics to revolutionize our understanding of infectious disease outbreaks. Her PhD project centers on leveraging AI and Machine Learning to predict disease outcomes and pathogen evolution. She's pioneering novel ML algorithms that fuse genomic data, epidemiology, and clinical information to forecast diagnoses and prognoses. Simultaneously, she's enhancing the Operation Outbreak simulation platform, infusing it with pathogen evolution models to dissect disease transmission and co-location networks. This platform also doubles as a tool for infectious disease literacy and STEM education, enriching middle, and high school curricula in both the US and Africa. Next on Winnie’s Agenda? Developing a cutting-edge multi-agent system for in silico pathogen evolution studies. Outside of research, Winnie enjoys spending time with family, indulging in music & singing, experimenting with culinary delights, and exploring nature.
